# Welcome!

I am an evolutionary biologist with a special interest in population and quantitative genetics of marine coastal invertebrates. I am also a science writer and host of the YouTube channel, @talkpopgen, which features videos on evolution education, the history and philosophy of science, and pseudoscience debunking. In August 2025, I will be joining the Department of Biological Sciences at Augusta University as an Assistant Professor. 

# Education

I received my Bachelor of Science from Texas A&M University-Texarkana under Dr. David Allard, where I researched species abundance, richness, and distribution of microcrustaceans of the Order Cladocera. I then did my PhD in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at Texas A&M University with Dr. Mary Wicksten. My thesis research focused on the systematics, population genetics, and genome evolution of marine amphipod crustaceans of the family Haustoriidae. Afterward, I did a postdoc with Dr. Gideon Bradburd at the University of Michigan, where I was involved in developing statistical methods in spatial population genetics.
