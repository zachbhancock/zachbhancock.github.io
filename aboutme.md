I am an evolutionary biologist with a special interest in population and quantitative genetics. 

I received my Bachelor of Science from Texas A&M University-Texarkana under Dr. David Allard, where I researched species abundance, richness, and distribution of microcrustaceans of the Order Cladocera. I then did my PhD in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at Texas A&M University with Dr. Mary Wicksten. My thesis research focused on the systematics, population genetics, and genome evolution of marine amphipod crustaceans of the family Haustoriidae. Afterward, I did a postdoc with Dr. Gideon Bradburd at the University of Michigan, where I was involved in developing statistical methods in spatial population genetics. 

In August 2025, I will be joining the Department of Biological Sciences at Augusta University as an Assistant Professor.
